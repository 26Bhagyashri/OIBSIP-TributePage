# OIBSIP-TributePage
A Tribute Page for Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam in HTML5 and CSS 
Here I have used Parallax scrolling to make webpage more attractive and responsive.
If you face while creating parallax through CSS and JS , keep in mind that JS is a interpreted language you should first go for HTML then CSS link it in HTML in <head> and last JavaScript also check for you have linked JS file in HTMML or not.
JS file can be linked in HTML code either in <head> or <body>.
